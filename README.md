# Project Proposal

## Project Name
**ResFinder**

## What and Why
ResFinder is a mobile app or website that makes it easier for people to find restaurants in their area. We are all familiar with Yelp, but ResFinder would allow more granular filtering as well as the ability to suggest restaraunts based on multiple locations given. 

## For Whom?
End-users would be anyone who is looking for new places to eat near them, like me and my friends. We have often been in situations where we are looking for places to eat and we spend the better part of searching Google results, reading reviews, and gauging people's tastes to try and figure out where we should go. 

## How?
ResFinder would be able to take multiple inputs and give recommendations based on them. For example, it would be able to:

- Take a location and give a list of restaurants within a certain radius, as well as be able to sort it based on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
  - Star rating
  - Number of reviews
  - Distance from location
  - Type of cuisine
  - Popularity (how busy is it right now?)
  - Price
  - Closing soon (adjustable, default would likely be 30 min)
- Take multiple locations and recommend the best restaurants near them, or search exclusively in an area between them (to see restaurants that are close to each location)
- Each restaurant recommendation also automatically pulls highlights from its menu (if available) 
- Restaurants can be marked as "seen" to prevent them from showing up in recommendations in the future (can be used to stop chain restaurants from appearing)

## Scope
This proposal should be doable for a group of 4-6 programmers across one semester. It would likely take a couple weeks to fully understand and utilize Google's Maps API, and the rest of the time should be making the UX as smooth as possible and implementing all the features outlined above. If more ideas for features come up, they can be added, or if time starts to run out, some features can be simplified in the final product.
