# Project Proposal

## Project Name
**ResFinder**

## What and Why
ResFinder is a mobile app or website that makes it easier for people to find restaurants in their area. We are all familiar with Yelp, but ResFinder would allow more granular filtering as well as the ability to suggest restaraunts based on multiple locations given. It can be a hassle trying to find new places nearby and there has been many a time where my friends and I have found ourselves scrolling endlessly through Google results to no avail, especially when we are gauging everyone's opinions and trying to take them into account.

## For Whom?
End-users would be anyone who is looking for new places to eat near them, most likely living in a major city, like my friends and I, but the app could still be helpful for people who are just visiting, like my family when we travel. Perhaps "foodies" would be most interested in an app like this, but in my experience, the larger the group, the more difficult it can be to find a good place to eat for everyone, regardless of whether or not there are foodies in the group.

## How?
ResFinder would be able to take multiple inputs and give recommendations based on them. For example, it would be able to:

- Take a location and give a list of restaurants within a certain radius, as well as be able to sort it based on a number of factors, including but not limited to:
  - Star rating
  - Number of reviews
  - Distance from location
  - Type of cuisine
  - Popularity (how busy is it right now?)
  - Price
  - Closing soon (adjustable, default would likely be 30 min)
- Take multiple locations and recommend the best restaurants near them within the specified radius, or search exclusively in an area between them (to see restaurants that are close to all the locations)
- Each restaurant recommendation also automatically pulls highlights from its menu (if available) and shows them without having to navigate to a separate menu
- Restaurants can be marked as "seen" to prevent them from showing up in recommendations in the future (can be used to stop chain restaurants from appearing)

## Scope
This proposal should be doable for a group of 4-6 programmers across one semester. It would likely take a couple weeks to fully understand and utilize Google's Maps API, and the rest of the time would be spent making the UX as smooth as possible and implementing all the features outlined above. If time starts to run out, some features can be simplified in the final product, or if there is more time available than expected, new features can be added. For example, perhaps a feature could be impelemented that allows a user to search restaurant menus for specific items, thus narrowing the search better than a general category like "American" or "Japanese".
